# OCAM web Outdoor Colective Activities Monitorization

Degree Final Project - Escuela de Ingeniería Informática de Oviedo (University of Oviedo). 

OCAM - Outdoor Colective Activities Monitorization aims to bolster security in outdoor group activities. This kind of activities, when being organised by associations that heed a Risk Management System, need an external coordinator whose task lies in serving as a link between the group activity, often suffering from a lack of communication due to its orographic condition and feeble coverage from mobile networks, and other external agents (rescue services, families, transports...). Therefore, it is suggested, by making use of new technologies, a trail and monitoring system of the group's doing the activity position.

OCAM fills this gap, allowing the management and monitoring of the activities, both from the inside being participant or from the outside for the organizers.

This management consists of the registration of activities, participants and continual monitorization of the position of all the people involved in the real-time activities, dealing with the problems related to coverage and supporting the guides of the activity and the external coordinator in the administration of possible vicissitudes that may occur during the activity.
